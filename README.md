🖤 Shadow Monarch Exercise Tracker

This is a simple web app inspired by Solo Leveling’s Shadow Monarch System. I built it to recreate the anime’s system panel vibe for real-life daily exercise tracking.

✨ What it does

✅ Shows daily exercises like push-ups squats and running

💪 Earns XP each time you complete an exercise

🔵 XP progress bar fills up dynamically

🎉 Displays a Level Up notification when you reach your target XP

🧠 Shows random motivational quotes to keep you going

🛠️ Tech used

HTML for structure

Tailwind CSS for styling with neon blue glowing UI and pure black backgrounds

Vanilla JavaScript for XP calculations and dynamic UI updates

🎯 Why I built it

To practice frontend skills using Tailwind CSS and JavaScript

To make workouts feel like Shadow Monarch training quests

To add an anime-themed project to my portfolio

🚀 Future plans

Integrate Firebase for storing progress and user data

Add sound effects for level up notifications

Include a summon shadows feature for aesthetic vibes
